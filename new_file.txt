Contextual awareness is key for the successful implementation of operations, projects and investments in many industries. While field information is still fundamental, collecting that data can be very expensive and may only be possible assuming high risks, especially in fragile and conflict-affected areas. Furthermore, contextual information in such areas becomes outdated very fast, which aggravates those limitations. The rise of object detection techniques, through machine learning and computer vision solutions, is facilitating new applications where images are automatically ingested to inform decision-making processes.
